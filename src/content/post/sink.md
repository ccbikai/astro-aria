I previously shared some websites on [Twitter](https://x.com/0xKaiBi) using short links to make it easier to see if people are interested. Among these link shortening systems, Dub provides the best user experience, but it has a fatal flaw: once the monthly clicks exceed 1000, you can no longer view the statistics.

While surfing the internet at home during the Qingming Festival, I discovered that [Cloudflare Workers Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/) supports data writing and API data querying. So, I created an MVP version myself, capable of handling statistics for up to 3,000,000 visits per month. Cloudflare's backend likely uses Clickhouse, so performance shouldn't be a significant issue.

During the Labor Day holiday, I improved the frontend UI at home and used it for about half a month, finding it satisfactory. I have open-sourced it for everyone to use.
